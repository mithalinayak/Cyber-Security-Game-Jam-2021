## What is this repository about?
This repository contains the source code to the game, "Hacked".  

"Hacked" is a 2D platformer adventure game that aims to educate users on password security.  

It clinched a **Suitability prize** at [Cybersecurity Game Jam](https://lnkd.in/g8wuV_5) organized by **SecurityGames at UC Berkeley School of Information**.

## What is this game about?
Passwords are the first line of defense against malicious hackers gaining access to your personal data.  

Despite knowing what makes a strong password, John, like 6.85 million other people in the world every day, still falls victim to password attacks.

In this quest, unlucky John seeks to

* acquire the knowledge to identify email phishing
* discover the use of password managers through revisiting the password-complexity-vs-memory dilemma which all of us encounter when creating passwords across sites
* and learn about the different types of common password attacks - password spraying and dictionary attacks  

In the midst, John evolves to gain his true identity... (Play our game **till the end** to find out what his true identity is!)
